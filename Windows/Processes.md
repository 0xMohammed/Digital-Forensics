# System

Image Path: N/A â€“ Not generated from an executable image
Parent Process: None
Number of Instances: One
User Account: Local System
Start Time: At boot time
Description: The System process is responsible for most kernel-mode threads.
Modules run under System are primarily drivers (.sys files), but also several
important DLLs as well as the kernel executable, ntoskrnl.exe

# smss.exe

Image Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\smss.exe
Parent Process: System
Number of Instances: One master instance and another child
instance per session. Children exit after creating their session.
User Account: Local System
Start Time: Within seconds of boot time for the master instance
Description: The Session Manager process is responsible for creating new sessions.
The first instance creates a child instance for each new session. Once the child instance
initializes the new session by starting the Windows subsystem (csrss.exe) and
wininit.exe for Session 0 or winlogon.exe for Session 1 and higher, the
child instance exits.

# wininit.exe

Image Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\wininit.exe
Parent Process: Created by an instance of smss.exe that exits,
so tools usually do not provide the parent process name.
Number of Instances: One
User Account: Local System
Start Time: Within seconds of boot time
Description: Wininit starts key background processes within Session 0. It starts
the Service Control Manager (services.exe), the Local Security Authority process
(lsass.exe), and the Local Session Manager (lsm.exe).

# taskhost.exe

Image Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\taskhost.exe
Parent Process: services.exe
Number of Instances: One or more
User Account: Multiple taskhost.exe processes are normal. One or
more may be owned by logged-on users and/or by local service accounts.
Start Time: Start times vary greatly
Description: The generic host process for Windows Tasks. Tasks are similar
in nature to services, and in fact beginning with Windows 7, are handled through
the same Universal Background Process Manager (UBPM) facility. Upon initialization,
taskhost.exe runs a continuous loop listening for trigger events. Example
trigger events that can initiate a task include a defined schedule, user logon, system
startup, idle CPU time, a Windows log event, workstation lock, or workstation unlock.
There are more than 70 tasks preconfigured on a default installation of Windows 7
Enterprise (though many are disabled). For example, defrag.exe is scheduled to run
against all volumes every Wednesday at 1:00 am. Another default task backs up the
core registry hive files every 10 days. All executable files (DLLs &
