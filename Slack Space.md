# Slack space
Each platter is composed of logically defined spaces called sectors and by default, most operating system (OS) sectors are configured to hold no more than 512 bytes of data. If a text file that is 400 bytes is saved to disk, the sector will have 112 bytes of extra space left overhe leftover storage that exists on a computerâ€™s hard disk drive when a computer file does not need all the space 
it has been allocated by the operating system. The examination of slack space is an important aspect of computer forensics.
